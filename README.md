# Whitehouse.gov Redirect Chrome Extension

On Jan 20th 2017, the contents of whitehouse.gov under the Obama administration
were migrated to obamawhitehouse.archives.gov. However, links and google
results were not updated, resulting in links failing.

This is a simple chrome extension that tries to redirect if the current
whitehouse.gov returns a 404.
